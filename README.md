Document differ proof-of-concept

----------------------

### TODO

- [x] create bare bones node script to extract text from image using `tesseract`
- [x] extend `test.js` such that it prints diffs between two images to console (`diff-match-patch`)
- [x] POC single page react app allowing user to select 2 images and displaying diff in browser
- [ ] Dream: select (and drag-and-drop rearrange) multiple pages for before/after with pretty-printed diff (e.g., github style diff)
- [ ] make it not look like complete shite

### Installation

- `$ git clone https://github.com/circld/doc_diff_poc.git`
